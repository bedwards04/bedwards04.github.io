            <p>My name is Brendan Edwards. I am from American Fork, Utah, I have been learning web development for a combined total of 12 weeks now, and I am loving every second of my learning experience! <br><br> Before I started to learn web development, I was a college student at Utah Valley University. After I had attended for about a year, that's when the COVID pandemic started. I decided to take a break from school to work full-time, and ended up with a job as a Fulfillment Associate at Amazon. While I was working for Amazon I discovered that coding bootcamps were a thing, so after doing some research I decided to enroll in one, and have not looked back since. <br><br>During the time that is not spent learning web development and sharpening my skills, you can usually find me watching movies and TV shows with friends or family, playing video games, listening to music, or playing sports, specifically basketball. </p>
